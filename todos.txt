1. Finish the package.json...
2. Write proper JavaDoc-like documentation for all this stuff...

3. Fix the bugs within the project: find them out with Deno; then, pray use the `tsc` for the actual compilation of the thing...

4. IDEA: about the in-editor types -- what about adding the JSDoc + using the .d.ts files for the libraries in question? 

	If one would use them loosely, perhaps would be nice. 
	Pray do think about it...
	Also -- if one was to restore the original "tsconfig.json" files for them + written the JSDoc, that could be done in a single command; 

	On the other hand... Does one really want this? 
	All that type malarkey... And for a language one would (most probably) wouldn't want to use again? 
	Current decision: nah, delete them later, along with the other typescript files... 

5. Get rid of the TypeScript within the project;
