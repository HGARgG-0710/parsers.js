1. Finish the package.json...
2. Write proper JavaDoc-like documentation for all this stuff...

3. Fix the bugs within the project: find them out with Deno and/or manually;

4. List of things transported to the math-expressions.js, but that are still wanted there anyway: recursiveIndexation, recursiveSetting;
