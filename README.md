# parsers.js

This is a library providing simple, yet general and powerful, interfaces for easing the process of
parser/tokenizer/code-generator-building, input-validation and manual regular-expression-construction.

It allows one to easily define reusable functions for parsing/code-generation/validation of various data formats,
as well as containing useful datatype definitions and general interfaces.

The library allows parsers (and similar structures) to be rewritten entirely in terms of maps of functions and
string-based typesystems, on which these maps are based.
